# Consensus Stability Implications of Transaction Fee Structures and Sequencers
  
 We will study the transaction pricing stuctures and sequencers across a number of protocols. We will study both layer one and layer two protocols. 

Follow this template for new research proposals, removing this text and replacing the *Flashbots Research Proposal Template* title with your proposal's own. Open a pull request to submit your proposal, using an abbreviated title in the filename (`proposal-short_title.md`), and put the file under the `FRPs` folder.

Use this initial section to provide a ~500 word summary of the proposal. The summary should consist in a simple straightforward statement of what your hypothesis is, what methodology you intend to use, what limitations those methods may have, what implications your results may have.

## Background and Problem Statement
  
The negative implications of deep reorg attacks were articulated clearly in [Flash Boys 2.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05234) paper. We aim examine similar concerns in a variety of other protocols. 
  
Provide motivation and background for the proposal, and clearly state the research questions it aims to tackle. Link to related or dependent Research Question(s) on the Flashbots Research Roadmap, and reference relevant Github Issues in this repository.

## Plan and Deliverables
  
We we examine fee protocols and sequencers in Solana, Avalanch, Algorand, Cosmos, Polygon, and Starknet. We will empirically measure cost of censorship and dominant MEV strategies on these protocols. 
  
We will produce and submit a paper for peer-reviewd publication outlining our findings in detail.

Describe the planned approach to the problem, including potential time allocations and partitioning into phases. List the artifacts or intended deliverables of the proposal.

Can someone add the rest of the white papers from the listed protocols?
